Description:
The Miracle Workers Housing App enables users to view apartment listings throughout the Charlottesville, Va area and is targeted at students at the University of Virginia. Using this app, any user can view and filter out apartment listings. If users create an account, they have access to additional features, such as saving favorites, leaving reviews, and creating a side-by-side comparison of listings. 


Login:
To login, begin by clicking the menu bar in the upper right hand corner, then click on the “Login” link that should appear on the screen. Login to the app using your preferred email address. This should take you back to the homepage. 


Search: 
To search for an apartment, type in the name of the apartment into the search bar, which should lead you the the apartments page. Alternatively, if you would like to view every available apartment, you can click on the “Apartments” tab at the top of the screen. From the Apartments page, you can also type in any apartment name you would like to view in the search bar. 

To filter your search, click the “Advanced Search” tab to the left of the search bar on the Apartments page. From there, you have the option to filter out apartments based on price, bedrooms, and ratings. 


Adding and Viewing Favorites:
You may want to save listings to view at a later time. To do so, you can add them to your Favorites page. To add a listing to your Favorites page, simply click “Save to Favorites List” on the Apartments listing page. Alternatively, you can go to an individual apartment’s detail page by clicking on that listing. From there, you also have the option to save that listing to your favorites. 

To view your favorites, click the “Favorites” tab at the top left corner of the screen. You can also access your favorites by clicking the “My Account” menu at the top right corner of the screen and navigating to the “Favorites” page from that menu bar. 


Reviews and Ratings:
If you find a specific apartment that you would like to rate or leave a review on, navigate to that apartment’s detail page by clicking on that apartment.

To leave a star rating of an apartment, scroll below the apartment’s image. The current star rating, which is the average of all users, will be reflected by pink stars. To leave your own star rating, click on the number of stars you feel reflects the quality of the apartment. 

Any existing reviews of the apartment should be below the star ratings. To leave you own review, simply type your review into the text box below and click submit. 


Compare Apartments:
The compare feature lets users select two apartments to create a side-by-side comparison of their features. Only two apartments may be compared at one time. 

To select your first apartment to compare, click “select as first apartment” on the desired apartment. This can be from the Apartment listings page, the Apartment detail page, or the Favorites page. Similarly, to select your second apartment, click “select as second apartment” on any of the previously named pages. 

To compare your selected apartments, navigate to the “Compare” tab. This can be found at the top left of the screen. Alternatively, you can click the “My Account” menu and select “Compare”. From there, you should have access to a side-by-side comparison of these two listings. 

From this compare page, you can also search for new apartments to compare using the two search bars.
